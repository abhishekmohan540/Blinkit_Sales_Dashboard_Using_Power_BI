# Blinkit_Sales_Dashboard_Using_Power_BI

- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key sales metrics including total sales ($1.20M), average sales ($141), number of items (8523), and average ratings (3.9) for a retail application.

- Designed and implemented visualizations to track sales performance by outlet establishment over time, outlet size (e.5., Medium, Small, High), outlet location (e.g., Tier 1, 2, 3), fat content, and item type.

- Utilized Power BI to identify sales trends and key performance indicators, such as the highest sales in 2018 ($205K) and insights into top-performing item types and outlet locations.

- Created a comprehensive dashboard that enables filtering by outlet location, outlet size, and item type, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
